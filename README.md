# Data Structures Projects
#### A collection of the projects I've coded for my coursework in my COMP 229: Data Structures class.

## For each of the homeworks, I accomplished making and utilizing a different data structure as a part of that assignment:
- Homework 1: Doubly-Linked List --> StringDoublyLinkedList.java
- Homework 2: AVL Tree --> AVLTreeMap.java
- Homework 3: Priority Queue --> EventPriorityQueue.java, PoliceDispatchSimulator.java
- Homework 4: Hash Set --> HashSet.java, SimpleLinearProbe.java, SimpleQuadraticProbe.java
- Homework 5: Graph Search Algorithm --> BreadthFirstSearch.java, DepthFirstSearch.java, AStarSearch.java
## If you want to access any of the code written:
- Click on any of the homework folders
- Click on the 'src' folder
- Click on any of the .java files to view the code written for the assignment

###### NOTE:
The main files to focus on are the ones I labeled with arrows; these are the files I mainly edited and weren't foundational/setup classes as a part of the assignment.
